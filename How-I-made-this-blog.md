# How I made this blog

## Clonning the repo

## Testing

## Switched most styling to tailwind

## Added a new footer

## Added new header

## Changed article and view styling

## Automatic image optimization

First idea:

Vite plugin.

Optimize at build/preview time
Have a file with metdata / embed metadata for file.
Only load if not present

## Robots.txt file

Allow anyone to crawl your website.
Good for SEO?

### OGP support

To allow fancy embedding on fb and other social media
